1.What happen if a user enter invalid field when registering, such as enter "test" into the email field?
A: It will not pass the underlying check performed by the model.

2. Most webpages required the user to login to access, what if a user does not login and try to access these pages through url?
A: This will raise the 404 error.

3. What if a user enter the url for logout even if he does not login?
A: Nothing happens


4. What if the user does not enter a email address while registering, then he will not receive notifications from the website.
The email field is optional in the provided(default) user model.
A: Customize the user model to change this field to required.
To make the email filed a required field, we can do it through two different methods:
1. We can ensure it using the required attribute in the form fields. -- Bad, the user might still be able to register without email.
2. Ensure it at database level. -- Good, but require us to create our own user model.


5. What if a user enter a invalid passengers when registering as the driver, or request a ride? For instance, the user may enter -5?
A: Provide validation, the valid passenger number is from 1 to 50.

6. We need to make sure that the first name and last name field is required in the underlying model instead of ensuring using form.
Some users may be able to bypass the form detection.
A: Customize the user model to change these fields to required.

7. What if a user who has already registered as driver still access the page to register as driver?
A: Provide a information such as "You have already registered as the driver" on the page, and do not allow the user to register again.

8. Should we check the format of the user's first name, last name and driver license?
A: We do not check it here, it should be straightforward to do so.

9. What if a user access a page which should only be accessed if the user is a driver?  For instance, the take request page, which allows the driver to search for requests and accept requests.
A: He should see a 404 page. The user must login and registered as the driver to see these pages.

10.The user should input a valid arrival_time(it must not in the past, we should do the valid check).
The user may enter a invalid time in two ways:
1. Invalid format
2. Invalid time in the past.
For 1, we use the form to check the format of the Datetime field.
For 2, we need to customize the clean method of the form to provide a valid check.

11.The time for request should be in the future, instead of past, same to 10.

12.What if a user accept a request (his car fulfills the requirement), then he changes the number of seats or other settings in his profile so that it does not fulfill the ride requirement, what will happen?
A: This behaviour should be dangerous, but we does not check this.

13.What happens if a user wants to join a ride as sharer through url?
The url for a user to join a ride is quite straightforward, as we use the ride id in the url.  Then the uesr may specify some random id in the url in order to join it.
However, the user may not be able to join these rides due to:
1. These rides may have status like confirmed or completed.
2. These rides are not shared.
A: We do valid check at the related view functions to prevent user to join invalid rides by specifying it in the url.

14.What happens if a driver wants to take a request through the url, same to 13.
A: We should do valid check to see whether the user can take the request.

15.What happens if a sharer search rides using time before now?
A: Invalid, provide a error message and let the user specify again.

16.Can the owner of the ride change the ride information after other users join the ride as sharer?
This can cause problems: If a user join the ride with party size 6, then the owner should not be able to set the ride passengers under 6.
A: We currently do not check this, but we should.
